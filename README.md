## 🚀 Project Overview

TradeStream is a backend portfolio project that demonstrates:

- Secure, production-grade APIs using **Java Spring Boot**
- Event-driven architecture with **Kafka or RabbitMQ**
- Decoupled microservices with independent **PostgreSQL & Redis** data stores
- Containerized deployment with **Docker & Docker Compose**
- Secure API authentication using **JWT**
- Real-time transaction processing simulation
- Cloud deployment on **AWS Lightsail**

⚠️ **Note:** This project is for educational and portfolio purposes only. It does not process real financial transactions.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

> _See [`/docs/architecture-diagram.png`](docs/architecture-diagram.png) for the full system diagram._

**Core Components:**

- **API Gateway:** Public entry point, request routing, token validation  
- **Authentication Service:** Issues JWT tokens after successful login  
- **Transaction Processor:** Handles transaction logic, publishes events  
- **Market Data Consumer:** Placeholder for future real-time market data processing  
- **Message Broker:** Kafka or RabbitMQ for decoupled, event-driven communication  
- **PostgreSQL & Redis:** Each microservice manages its own independent data stores

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed  
- Basic familiarity with Java, Spring Boot, and containers  

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tradestream.git
cd tradestream

# Build and run containers
docker-compose up --build
````

Access:

* API Gateway at `http://localhost:8080`
* Login, transaction, and health endpoints per the [API Design](docs/api-design.md)

---
