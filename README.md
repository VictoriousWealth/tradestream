# TradeStream — Real-Time Financial Data Processor

> A scalable, resilient microservice-based system that simulates real-time financial transaction processing, following engineering practices used in financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

TradeStream demonstrates:

- Secure, production-grade APIs using **Java Spring Boot**
- **Event-driven architecture** with Kafka or RabbitMQ
- Independent microservices with PostgreSQL & Redis per service
- Containerized, isolated deployment using Docker & Docker Compose
- Secure authentication with **JWT**
- Real-time transaction processing simulation
- Cloud deployment using **AWS Lightsail**

**Note:** This project is a self-initiated portfolio and learning exercise. It simulates real-world financial system patterns but does not process actual financial data.

Planned Future Enhancements:

- Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Terraform for infrastructure as code
- Prometheus & Grafana for observability
- Advanced API security measures
- Introduce a CD pipeline

## 🏗️ System Architecture

> _See [`/docs/architecture-diagram.png`](docs/architecture-diagram.png) for full architecture overview._

**Core Components:**

- **API Gateway:** Public entry point, request routing, token validation
- **Authentication Service:** Issues JWT tokens upon successful login
- **Transaction Processor:** Processes simulated transaction logic, publishes events
- **Market Data Consumer:** Placeholder for future real-time market data processing
- **Message Broker:** Kafka or RabbitMQ for decoupled, event-driven communication
- **PostgreSQL & Redis:** Each service owns its independent data stores

## ⚙️ Getting Started (MVP Setup)

### **Prerequisites**

- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Basic familiarity with running Java services in containers

### **Steps**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tradestream.git
cd tradestream

# Build and run containers
docker-compose up --build
```

Services exposed:

* `http://localhost:8080` — API Gateway
* Authentication, transaction, and health endpoints accessible per Technical Design

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

* Follows secure coding practices from Day 1
* API authentication with JWT
* Secure service-to-service communication within private Docker network
* Future enhancements planned for: rate limiting, RBAC, secure headers, vulnerability scanning
