## Authentication Service ![SECURITY: HIGH](https://img.shields.io/badge/SECURITY-HIGH-brightgreen)

This microservice handles user authentication and secure token issuance in the **TradeStream** system. It generates **signed access tokens** and **encrypted refresh tokens**, using modern cryptographic standards to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and tamper-proof delivery across services.

### Responsibilities ![JWT](https://img.shields.io/badge/JWT-ENABLED-green) ![SIGNING: RSA-PSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/SIGNING-RSA--PSS%20\(PS256\)-blue)

* Verifies login credentials from users.
* Issues signed **access tokens** (JWS) for stateless, tamper-evident API authorization.
* Issues **encrypted refresh tokens** (JWE) for secure re-authentication.
* Signs tokens using **PS256 (RSA-PSS + SHA-256)** to avoid algorithm substitution attacks.
* Interfaces with the API Gateway, which handles token delivery and validation.

---

### Security Highlights ![HTTPS ONLY](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTTPS-ENFORCED-green) ![AES-256-GCM](https://img.shields.io/badge/ENCRYPTION-AES--256--GCM-yellowgreen)

* **Private RSA Key Usage**

  * The service uses a **private RSA key**, securely injected via environment variables, to sign all access tokens and refresh token inner payloads.

* **Refresh Token Encryption**

  * The API Gateway encrypts refresh tokens using **AES-256-GCM** and a **randomly generated CEK**, which is itself encrypted with the API Gatewayâ€™s **RSA public key**.

* **HTTPS Enforcement**

  * All client communication flows through HTTPS to ensure end-to-end security, especially for login and refresh flows.

### How It Works ![JWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/ACCESS%20TOKEN-JWS-blue) ![JWE](https://img.shields.io/badge/REFRESH%20TOKEN-JWE-yellow)

#### Login Flow:

1. Client sends login request with credentials over HTTPS.
2. If credentials are valid:

   * Access token is generated and signed (JWS using `PS256`).
   * Refresh token payload is also signed (JWS), then encrypted by the API Gateway (JWE).
   * Tokens are returned to the client via API Gateway.

#### Refresh Flow:

1. Client sends refresh token via HTTPS.
2. API Gateway decrypts it, validates the signature.
3. If valid, Authentication Service issues a new access token.

---

### Configuration ![CONFIGURABLE](https://img.shields.io/badge/CONFIG-ENV--BASED-blue)

* `PRIVATE_KEY`: RSA private key for signing.
* `JWT_EXPIRATION`: Access token expiration window.
* `JWT_ISSUER`, `JWT_AUDIENCE`: Used in the `iss` and `aud` claims.

---

### TODO / Future Improvements ![WORK IN PROGRESS](https://img.shields.io/badge/MAINTENANCE-ACTIVE-blue) ![TESTS NEEDED](https://img.shields.io/badge/TESTS-MISSING-red)

* Add unit and integration tests for token validation logic.
* Add metrics for login success/failure tracking.
* Rotate keys securely via KMS or secrets manager.
