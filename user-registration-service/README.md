# ðŸš€ User Registration Service

* A simple user registration microservice

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview


* It allows the registration of new users using a provided username and password
* I built it because I want to learn how to build microservices after reading so much about them - this will be used in tradestream 
* I used Java SpringBoot, Flyway, Docker, and Gradle
* Any unique twist or feature? 
  It has an internal caller interceptor that only forwards requests from my api gateway by checking the header of each request
